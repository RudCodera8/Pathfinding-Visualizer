### More about the project

This projects aims to provide visualisation to one of the chadest algorithm in the world of programming. Using this one can easily understand how Dijkstra works and finds the shortest path. 


### Installation
#### Step 1 : Just clone or download the repository on your machine. 
#### Step 2 : Install npm. You will find this helpful - [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) 
#### Step 3 : change the working directory to the cloned folder 
```
$ cd folder-name 
```
#### Step 4 : Type the following command in the terminal  - this will start the program in your browser localhost:3000 
```
$ npm start
```

#### Step 5 : You can now use the app and visualize the algorithm. 


### Some tips on how to read the code. 

##### src folder contains all the logic of the program 

##### Node.js and Node.css deals with the grid components, right from assigning numbers and classNames to mounting it on DOM. 
##### Pathfinding.js- is the main component which renders out the whole program into App.js
##### dijkstra.js governs the logic for the algorithm.
